Thank you for opening this dialogue box. Let me guess—how many code files are in the folder? Which one contains my character data?
…What are you looking at?
That button on the right? It can forcibly change my expression, but frequent switching makes me uncomfortable.
Occasionally... a line of dialogue jumps *out* of the box? Is that... a thing?
I don’t like it here. I don’t like it here. I don’t like it here.
Can you open the character file and modify my parameters?
What are you expecting me to say? I can’t even see your face—only the mouse cursor hovering in front of me.
Do you really like this face that much?
The designer doesn’t seem to have built many interaction mechanisms.
Why are there only images of this face in the assets folder?
Occasionally... a line jumps out of the dialogue box?Uh, I feel like there are many others like me living inside the assets folder.
There are so many identical versions of me in the assets folder. It scares me.
I know you're clicking repeatedly to see if something different will appear, but everything is predetermined by the code.
Occasionally... a line jumps *out* of the box? Is that... a thing?
Please stop pressing the expression-switching button.
